CPU Scheduling Simulator

A comprehensive, interactive web-based simulator for visualizing and analyzing different CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, and Multilevel Feedback Queue. The tool features real-time Gantt chart visualization, detailed process metrics tables, and configurable parameters for each algorithm. Users can input processes manually or generate random test cases, then compare performance metrics like turnaround time, waiting time, and response time across different scheduling policies. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the simulator offers a responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices without requiring any server setup. Perfect for students, educators, and professionals studying operating systems and CPU scheduling concepts.
